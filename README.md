# TODO

We'll use Java (`springboot`) to build this api.

Some tasks:

- [] Handle CRUD operations on the notes (notes are written in markdown), namely:
  - [] `POST` requests to create notes
  - [] `GET` requests to get/read notes
  - [] `UPDATE` to update notes
  - [] `DELETE` to delete notes
- [] Handle user authentication
