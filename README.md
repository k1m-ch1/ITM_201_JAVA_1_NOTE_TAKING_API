# TODO

We'll use Java (`springboot`) to build this api.

Some tasks:

## Main tasks

- [] Handle CRUD operations on the notes (notes are written in markdown), namely:
  - [] `POST` requests to create notes
  - [] `GET` requests to get/read notes
  - [] `UPDATE` to update notes
  - [] `DELETE` to delete notes
- [] Handle user authentication

## Side tasks

- [] turn the markdown into pdf or a webpage or slides or something (can use `pandoc`)
- [] maybe do some `latex` or `typst`
